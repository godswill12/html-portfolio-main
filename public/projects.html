      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Electromechanical system for a fuel dispenser</h3>
          I designed a prototype of a fuel dispenser using AC solenoid valves
          <br />
          and some electronic circuit, all programmed using Arduino.
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Automated irrigation system for farms</h3>
          Designed a smart system that irrigates the farm automatically <br />
          based on the time of the day and moisture level in the soil. <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Webserver for obtaining user's WiFi configuration with ESP32</h3>
          Wrote a program that allows users to input WiFI credentials via <br />
          a web page without hardcoding it in the code. <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Automatic Changeover</h3>
          Designed an automatic changeover that changes from the <br />
          generator to Grid power and also turns off the generator. <br />
          This can be controlled using a mobile app as well. <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>IoT system</h3>
          An IoT system for Unitec Protection under a Non-Disclosure <br />
          Agreement (NDA) <br />
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>IoT system</h3>
            An IoT system for Platforms Innovations under a Non-Disclosure <br />
            Agreement (NDA) <br />
