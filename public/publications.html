            Machine learning-inspired weather forecasting for solar photovoltaic
            potential
          </h3>
          There is little penetration of renewable energy systems such as solar
          energy in Nigeria (95% Fossil Fuel generation). This is because there
          is
          <br />
          no detailed report showing the potential of clean power generation
          systems due to the dysfunctional meteorological stations in the
          country.
          <br />
          This research provides a machine learning-inspired forecasting of the
          environmental weather parameters that can be used by the
          <br />
          government and manufacturing companies in evaluating the potential and
          profitability of citing renewable energy systems in the region.
